## 🎨 Design Decisions

### User Experience
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interactions reduce friction
- **Visual Product Cards**: Rich product information displayed inline in chat
- **Quick Actions**: Common queries accessible with one click
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during AI processing
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

### AI Agent Design
